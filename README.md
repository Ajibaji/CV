## Ammar Arjomand

Father, Husband and developer of ideas, code and tangible things. Very varied experience, ranging from residential and retail development to full stack web development and IT consulting. My ideal would be an agile, close-knit team of diverse minds and skills working together on something that pushes the bounds of what most consider possible...or something in accounting.


## Skills

#### Problem solving

Probably a favourite of mine since it is it's own reward with the added bonus of the acquired knowledge. I enjoy the challenge of solving or getting around a problem. Whether it be mechanical, legal or virtual in nature, I love exploring possibility and overcoming hurdles to produce a reality. Wearing many hats over the years has helped broaden my horizons in this regard. Tech in general is a very real passion of mine (...and skiing/snowboarding) and I'm always looking forward to the next challenge.

#### Fast learner

The ability to independently learn quickly is a skill that has allowed me to take on many roles and responsibilities over the years. My varied work experience, in-turn, has further developed my ability to learn quickly as my reputation pushed me into more and more challenging roles.

## MAJOR PROJECTS

#### Selenium Grid running in AWS Lambda
Feb 2019 - April 2019

A world first - unprecedented exploitation of AWS Lambda's underlying power and near-instant scaling ability to enable massive parallel execution of full end-to-end test-suites, reducing execution times from tens of minutes down to the time it takes to execute the longest-running single test in the suite (usually a couple of minutes). All in a standard Selenium Grid network formation with normal Selenium reporting. 
Each Lambda instance executes a single test only, therefore increasing reliability and reducing flakiness. This setup enables end-to-end testing to move further left, and costs less in the process. This is Selenium *Grid* and not just multiple instances of Selenium Standalone Server

#### Mobile Automated Testing Framework
Jan 2019 - Feb 2019

Creation and deployment of an automated mobile testing framework into a CI pipeline. Project was for a UK television network, consisting of Appcelerator based, cross-platform product. Appium (javascript test scripting) was used for testing and AWS Device Farm was utilised for parallel, real-device execution with Jenkins controlling the flow. 

#### Selenium Grid
Nov 2018 – Jan 2019

Creation scripts utilising industry standard tools, methods and services to deploy fast, secure, stable, scalable Selenium Grids on AWS (EC2, ECS, Fargate), GCP (Compute Engine and Cloud Run - Fargate equivalent, currently in Private Alpha) and Azure (VM and container instances). 
- Terraform (community, enterprise)
- Vault
- Packer
- Ansible
- Docker (containers, machine, swarm)
- Selenium (custom servlets, proxies)
- Bash/Chrome/Firefox/Xvfb

#### React Native/Axios/Node/Express based mobile app
Oct 2018 – Nov 2018

Project descriptionCross-platform, hybrid mobile app.
Front-end
- React Native

Back-end
- Axios
- Express
- Nodejs

Database

#### Gyet
Sep 2018 – October 2018

A RESTful shared shopping list app with google assistant (OK GOOGLE...) for a front end. Built using NodeJS, Express and MangoDB. Working on automatic ordering from 3rd-party vendor based on previous brand purchase habits...

#### Nice
May 2018 – May 2018

Nice is a single-button mobile phone application (iOS, Android) that facilitates charitable donations to a random UK registered charity. Developed with strict adherence to TDD principles and within a space of 5 days with zero prior knowledge or experience in any of the languages used in the stack; Python, Flask, Pytest, React Native, Axios, Jest, MongoDB and hosted on Heroku/mLab. 

The idea was to create an app that would allow it's user to "pass it forward" whenever they got randomly lucky IRL without giving a charity company enough personal details to emotionally blackmail you for more money (the app is anonymous by default but can be changed by ticking a single check-box).

## Training & Education

Hashicorp's enterprise offerings are the focus, so training centres around Terraform, Consul, Vault and Nomad

#### Makers Academy (2/2018 to 5/2018)

- Curious and passionate about code. I have been experimenting with code since 7 years old, starting with BASIC on an AMSTRAD 6128+ all the way through to university where I gained experience in a much wider variety of languages. It gives me a real buzz to solve a problem or make a 'thing' or even just understand something technically complicated so naturally, code was always going to be in my life. Makers has brought this passion back into the spotlight for me and the rewards have been fantastic.
- Fast, independent learner. If necessity is the mother of all creation, it's not possible to be as passionate about making things as I am without understanding and getting the hang of new skills quickly. In my final project at Makers Academy I had only 6 days to learn a brand new stack (Python - Flask, MongoDB, React Native, JustGiving.com API) and present a final product in the form of a native iOS and Android app - [linked here](https://github.com/RandJam/nice). It was a success and I look forward to similar challenges.
- Great collaborator. Working in a small team is where I have really thrived at Makers. I think a small group of keen, believers in a project is greater than the sum of its parts; many times over. Not just in what it delivers outwards but just as important, what it gives each member of the team. At Makers I was fortunate enough to be a part of several such teams and we made our MVP for every project and within the time limit (usually 5 days). Pair programming has also been key to maintaining momentum and healthy work balance while boosting understanding and cutting over-all learning times for the group as a whole.
