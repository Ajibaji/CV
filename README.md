## Ammar Arjomand

Father, Husband and developer of ideas, code and tangible things. Very varied experience, ranging from residential and retail development to full stack web development and IT consulting. My ideal would be a nimble, close-knit team of believers working together on something truly disruptive, pushing the bounds of what people in general realise to be possible...or something in accounting.


## Skills

#### Problem solving

Probably a favourite of mine since it is it's own reward with the added bonus of the knowledge that comes with tackling an issue. I enjoy the challenge of solving or getting around a problem. Whether it be mechanical, legal or virtual in nature I love considering possibility and making it such. Wearing many hats over the years has helped broaden my horizons in this regard. Tech in general is a very real passion of mine (...and skiing/snowboarding) and I'm eagerly looking forward to it's challenges.
